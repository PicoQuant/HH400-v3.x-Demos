## What's new in this Version 3.0

Version 3.0 is an improvement release that supersedes versions 2.x.
Please upgrade if you installed version 2.x. If you are still using
version 1.x, please read the following notes carefully.


## What's new in version 2.0 versus 1.2

- Supports HydraHarp devices with USB 3.0 interface
- Supports time bin widths of up to 33.5 Âµs and histogram time spans
  up to 2.2 seconds.
- Supports compressed TTTR overflow records for file size reduction at
  low count rates.
- Fixes some minor bugs.
- **NOTE 1:** Version 2.0 requires a firmware update of the HydraHarp device.
  The HydraHarp software can perform this update when it is first started.
- **NOTE 2:** This version has a new TTTR data format.

**IMPORTANT! The firmware update requirement has consequences that you
must observe:**

1. Once the update is performed you will no longer be able to use any
   HydraHarp software prior to version 2.0.
2. Custom software you may have written for file import will require
   minor adaptions for version 2.0.
3. You will no longer be able to use custom software based on HHLib.dll
   prior to version 2.0.
4. Custom DLL-based software you may have written will require minor
   adaptions for version 2.0.
5. In case of a power failure or computer crash during the update the
   device may become in-operational.
6. Reverting to old firmware or repairing a disrupted update requires
   a return to factory and may incur costs.


## Installation

Before installation, make sure to backup any work you kept in previous
installation directories and uninstall any older versions of HHLib.
The HHLib package can be distributed on CD, via download or via email.
The setup distribution file is setup.exe.
If you received the package via download or email, it may be packed in a
zip-file. Unzip that file and place the distribution setup file in a
temporary disk folder. Start the installation by running setup.exe before
connecting the HydraHarp device.

The setup program will install the programming library including manual,
and programming demos. Note that the demos create output files and must
have write access in the folder where you run them. This may not be the
case in the default installation folder. If need be, please adjust the
acces permissions or copy the demos to a suitable folder.

Before uninstalling the HHLib package, please backup your measurement data
and custom programs.
From the start menu select:  PicoQuant - HydraHarp-HHLib v2.x  >  uninstall.
Alternatively you can use the Control Panel Wizard 'Add/Remove Programs'
(in some Windows versions this Wizard is called 'Software')
